You need :
i3, lemonbar, pywal, dmenu2, feh, rofi, xdotool
urxvt (or any pywal compatible terminal, but i recommend urxvt),
tewi & siji bitmap fonts (included)

if you want to change the wallpaper, set it using wal.
then hit super+shift+r to fully reload the config.
and don't forget to read the configuration files before use.

the workspace indicator in lemonbar use xdotool to determine the current workspace.
the recycle behaviour of i3 makes xdotool confuse.
i don't know a better solution.
